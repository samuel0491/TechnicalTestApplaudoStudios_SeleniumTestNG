In this challenge, Applaudos Studios requested me:

For following website: http://automationpractice.com/index.php build a solution to test below conditions:

1. Add item to shopping cart

2. Remove item inside shopping cart

3. Search item (include at least one positive and negative condition)

4. Validate store information (scroll down to footer and check for Store Information)

What did I do?
